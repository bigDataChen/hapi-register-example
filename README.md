# hapi-register-example

This example is a showcase for using the
[**hapi-register**](https://github.com/nelsonic/hapi-register) plugin
for a simple (*yet complete*) web/app registration process.

To run this example *locally*, you will need to export
a `PORT` environment variable:

```sh
export PORT=8000
```
